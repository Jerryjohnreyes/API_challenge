Conclutions:

* Clearly there is a linear dependence between Max Temperature versus Latitude
within the northern hemisphere, which has a negative slope this is for a greater
there is a lower Max Temperature.
There is the same behavior in the southern hemisphere with a positive slope.

* There are some limitations trying to describe a lineal model that describes the
relation between Latitud and Humidity, Cludiness, Wind Speed. 

* Places close to the Equatorial line tend to have higher Max temperatures than
places that are further.
